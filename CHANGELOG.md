# Changelog

All notable changes to Jean are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Files sidebar: a context menu on file and folder rows.** A row could only
  be left-clicked into Jean's internal viewer. A right-click now gives Open,
  Open in your editor, Open in Default App, Reveal in Finder, Open in Terminal
  (folders only), Add to Chat, Copy Path and Copy Relative Path.
  - "Reveal in Finder" selects the target inside its parent folder. Windows
    shows it in Explorer. Linux opens the parent folder, because it has no
    portable flag to select a file.
  - "Open in Default App" hands the file to the application the operating
    system has registered for it, so images and PDFs no longer open in a code
    editor.
  - "Add to Chat" puts the row into the composer as an `@mention` and attaches
    the file, the same as the `@` popover does.
  - Items that need a host shell are hidden in web access. Open, Add to Chat
    and the two copy items stay available.

### Fixed

- **Sidebar: "Completed" and "Cancelled" session statuses now change the row.**
  Setting a session to Completed had no visible effect, and Cancelled did not
  move the row out of the Review section. Three causes were corrected:
  - Completed shared the green indicator with "Review ready". It now has its own
    light-blue dot, in the sidebar as well as in the unread bell and the command
    palette.
  - Completed, Cancelled, Review and Crashed all shared one "Review" section.
    Completed and Cancelled each get their own sidebar section now. Crashed stays
    under Review, because it still needs attention.
  - A pinned Completed or Cancelled status was discarded while a session waited
    for a plan approval or an answer, so the pin did nothing. A pinned terminal
    status now wins over a waiting status. It still does not hide a run that is
    in flight, scheduled, or crashed.
